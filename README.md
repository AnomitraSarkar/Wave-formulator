# Used JS to simulate a String forming waves in 1D waves, following the waves and oscilattory mechanics: Simple HArmonic Motion Per particle

run the index.html in your local server or by just double tapping on the file
and then click on string drag it along to produce waves

the waves do the following:
1. travel the wave in a transverse manner | medium required wave
2. travel via following loss of energy of simply put damping
3. reflecting at edges and at point
4. visulazing slope wave traversal at endpoint selection
